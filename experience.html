                        This past summer I was an intern at SpaceX on the FPGA team. During my internship, I learned a lot about the <b>FPGA design flow</b> 
						through independent projects and mentorship from experienced engineers on my team. I enjoyed the small team environment and
						how willing everyone on both my team and the verification team was to answer my questions.

						C2S2 is a student-run project team
						that uses open-source tools to tape out custom silicon chips.
                        C2S2 is a unique opportunity for me to learn about <b>ASIC Design</b> outside of the classroom. C2S2 is much less structured
						than a regular college course, which means I am able to learn much more about the tools that we use because I am doing everything from scratch.
						I also appreciate the <b>collaborative learning culture</b> of C2S2. Everyone is willing to teach each other what they know and explain what they are working on, 
						even across different disciplines. Learn more about my C2S2 projects on my <a href="projects.html"><b>projects page.</b></a><br>

						As part of Professor Matt Reynolds' research group, I have gained valuable experience working in a research lab. 
						I work closely with Professor Reynolds and apply the concepts that I learned in class to understand new and novel research ideas. 
						I also read papers about previous work on the mode-stirring system to understand the status of the project before I joined to learn
						how my work would be pushing the project forward.
						Ultimately, I co-authored a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10178597" target="_blank"><b>paper</b></a> that was published in the 2023 IEEE International Conference on RFID.

						Cornell Cup Robotics is a student-run project team that focuses on various robotics projects. While on Cup, I was on the <b>Minibot Electrical Subteam</b>, and became
						lead for the subteam in the Fall of 2022. Minibot is an <b>educational modular robot</b> with the goal of teaching elementary-aged students robotics and coding. 
						Being lead taught me <b>project management skills</b> such as how to effectively handle interpersonal
						conflicts, organize a large project and delegate work. I worked closely with the CS and Mechanical subteams to fully integrate the Minibot system. 
						I also gained embedded systems experience working with Arduinos and motors. I decided to shift my focus towards C2S2 in Fall 2023.
