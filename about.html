                        My name is Madeleine Lee and I am currently a senior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering 
						at <b>Cornell University</b>. 
						After taking Computer Architecture, and interning at <b>SpaceX</b> on their FPGA team, 
						I found that I am particularly interested in chip design at the RTL. <br><br>
						I am looking to expand my skills and understanding of the chip design field by 
						either beginning FPGA work in the <b>industry</b> or pursuing a <b>Master's degree</b> next year.
						Until then, I am making the most of my senior year by going to as many hockey games as possible and 
						soaking up all that Ithaca and Cornell have to offer!

					<h2>👩‍💻 chip designer</h2>
					<p>
						After taking Computer Architecture, and interning at <b>SpaceX</b> on their FPGA team, 
						I found that I am particularly interested in chip design at the RTL. 
						I am a member of <a href="https://c2s2.engineering.cornell.edu/" target="_blank"><b>Cornell Custom Silicon Systems</b></a>: 
						a student-run project team
						that uses open-source tools to tape out custom silicon chips. 
						I recently co-wrote a blog post for C2S2 about different numerical representations in hardware- 
						check it out <a href="https://c2s2.engineering.cornell.edu/blogposts/FA23/RepresentingNumbersInHardware" target="_blank"><b>here!</b></a>

					<h2>🥳 foodie, coffee addict and much more!</h2>
					<p>
						In my free time I love to explore new cafes and restaurants with friends and family. 
						Some of my current favorite coffee spots in Ithaca are Temple of Zeus, Gimme Coffee, and Hound and Mare. 
						I also love to travel and recently got back from a semester abroad in Barcelona!
